# Task-logger-Time-management
Simple terminal task logger / time manager application with a simple data visualization module.

If you want to see a simple graph(instead of the bar graph) in the terminal showing the time spent on each task/activity, you can pass the parameter 'plot' to the function *user_data_visualize()*
which is called with the visualize command inside Commands.py

This application doesn't store any data, that means it will delete all logs after exiting. :(
